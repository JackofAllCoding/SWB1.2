<div ><div class="answer"><p class="q">What drive train do they have?</p>
<p class="a">Mecanum</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">What motors are they using for the drive train?</p>
<p class="a">Neo</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">How much does the robot weigh?</p>
<p class="a">105.3</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">What do you do during autonomous?</p>
<p class="a">Driving forward (working on autonomous path finding)</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">How far can the shooter shoot?</p>
<p class="a">Decently forward (not from trench but definitely “far”)</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">If they have a shooter, how many balls can it hold at once?</p>
<p class="a">5.0</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">If they have a shooter, how does it work?</p>
<p class="a">Intake rolls in balls and conveyer belt brings to shooter which wheels them out</p></div>
<div class="answer"><p class="q">Can they use the control panel (wheel of fortune)?</p>
<p class="a green">Yes</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p class="q">What is their overall match strategy?</p>
<p class="a">Pretty much anything. Autonomous drives forward. Collects all the balls and shoots then. After that go to control panel and collect balls from other side. Then in end game “send it” over the metal bar. Mecanom  wheels can just climb at the end.</p></div>
